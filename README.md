## Screener
Display capture published via [Syphon](http://syphon.v002.info) for OS X 10.8+.

#### GENERAL
`Screener` takes cues from the [v002 Screen CapturePlugIn](https://github.com/v002/v002-Media-Tools) and provides a standalone application that publishes a display's content to a Syphon server. For high-quality recording needs, the intention is to pair with [Syphon Recorder](http://syphon.v002.info/recorder/). Please select an appropraite compressor, output resolution and frame rate to fit available hardware resources - for more information, see the menu item *Syphon Recorder Help* in Syphon Recorder's *Help* menu.

#### HOW TO BUILD
- Clone the repository and submodules `git clone --recursive git://github.com/pizthewiz/Screener.git`
- Open the project in Xcode, Build and Run.
