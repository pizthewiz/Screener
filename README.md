## Screener
Display capture published via [Syphon](http://syphon.v002.info) for OS X 10.9.

In large, Screener takes cues from the [v002 Screen CapturePlugIn](https://github.com/v002/v002-Media-Tools) and provides a standalone application that publishes a display's content to a Syphon server. For high-quality recording needs, the intention is to pair with [Syphon Recorder](http://syphon.v002.info/recorder/).
