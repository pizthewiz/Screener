### NOW
- [ ] add an application icon

### LATER
- [ ] setup version info
- [ ] figure out why window cannot be resized, lock context?
- [ ] option to hide preview
- [ ] draw something less cute on the 'NONE' screen
- [ ] is there any benefit to use an FBO instead of separate textures for preview and Syphon server feeding?
- [ ] check out if a core profile app can send a texture to a syphon server. see the thread [OpenGL 3.2 Context causes glitches?](http://v002.info/forums/topic/opengl-3-2-context-causes-glitches/)
