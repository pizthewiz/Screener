### NOW
- [ ] prevent texture stretching in preview
- [ ] include screenshot in [README.md](README.md)
- [ ] the display link may not be necessary, the display stream might handle it
- [ ] add an application icon

### LATER
- [ ] option to hide previewsy
- [ ] draw something less cute on the 'NONE' screen
- [ ] is there any benefit to use an FBO instead of separate textures for preview and Syphon server feeding?
- [ ] check out if a core profile app can send a texture to a syphon server
